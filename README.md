# Deep-Learning-Radiomics-Research-in-Breast-Cancer
## Requirements
* python3.8.12
* pytorch1.10.2+cu113
* tensorboard 2.8.0
## Usage
### 1.dataset
CT images and clinicopathological information of the fourth and eleventh thoracic vertebrae in 421 patients with breast cancer.
### 2.train the densenet121 model
The parameters of the model have been written into process.py.You need to train the model with the following commandsï¼š  
`$ python process.py`  
Determine whether the training data is the fourth level thoracic vertebra or the eleventh level thoracic vertebra by modifying the root variable in process.py. The save_path variable is the path of the trained weight file in process.py.
### 3.run tensorboard
`$ tensorboard --logdir=./Result`
### 4.Extract image features
The img_root variable in predict.py determines the image to extract features (such as the test set of the fourth thoracic vertebra:'./data/T4-jipangji-predict',the test set of the eleven thoracic vertebra:'./data/T11-neizang-predict'), and the weights_path variable determines which trained network weight to use.  
`$ python predict.py`
### 5.RandomForest classification
The datasets models that combine the network features extracted at different levels with clinical information are run (in order: Clinical information combined DLR (T4&T11), Clinical information combined DLR (T4), Clinical information combined DLR (T11), Classification by clinical information).

  `cd model`
  `$ python rf_T4_T11.py`	
  `$ python rf_T4.py`	
  `$ python rf_T11.py`
  `$ python rf_clinical.py`
